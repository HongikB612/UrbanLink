## What's Urbanlink?
* It is a 'space-based multi-purpose community app'.
* Our appâ€™s goal is to help users appreciate and rediscover their local surroundings, transforming them into more vibrant and dynamic spaces.
* Often, we might overlook events happening nearby, but with our service, users can stay informed about their city, local happenings, and the people who livin our city.

### UI description
* First screen: The blue circle of animation represents the space where the user has a relationship with others based on the space, and the expansion and movement of the circle represents the purpose of the app, "human connection."
* Map page: You can see the area where the community was formed at the location of the circle, and the size of the circle indicates the range of the community. When you press the bottom button, the community with the fast speed of generating posts among the communities is emphasized through color and size variations. This function is designed to share issues around the world, and the increased accessibility resulting from this effect also leads to increased communication as it broadens the user's spatial awareness.

### Future plans  
We are planning to add a space recommendation function in the future. Also, in terms of pursuing convergence in urban spaces such as parks and youth shelters, we are considering promoting the space by recommending the places we paid attention to.
